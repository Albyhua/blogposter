# Model-View-Controller (MVC): Blog site

## Description

Programmers need a space to vent out, spread ideas, make jokes, or just give advice to other programmers in our field. I have created a simple yet effective app that give programmers a space to let their creativity out rather than fixing a bug that is taking them hours to fix. Here, they can ask other programmers how to fix that bug too!
